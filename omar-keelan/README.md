Tic Tac Toe
This game will be for two users, playing on one device, taking turns. You will have to use component state to keep track of whose turn it is and which squares have been marked by each player.

This project will challenge your knowledge of React but should also be an exercise in creating good user experiences. Your view should be styled to look good as well as function flawlessly.

User Stories:
.As a user, I should start off seeing a 3x3 grid on the main page.
.As a user, I should be able to click on a square to mark it.
.As a user, my partner should be able to click on a square after me and see their mark.
.As a user, I shouldn't be able to click on a square that has already been selected.
.As a user, when someone has won the game (3 squares in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) I should see a notice telling me who won.
.As a user, I should not be able to continue playing the game after the game has been won.
.As a user, if there are no more squares available, I should see a notice telling me that the game has ended.
.As a user, I should see a restart button that when clicked will clear the gameboard.


.Stretch Goals:
As a user, I can see a notification that informs me whether it is currently player one's or player two's turn.
As a user, I can choose my marker (X, O, a color, an emoji, etc...).

















































<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
